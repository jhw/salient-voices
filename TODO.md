### thoughts

### done

- notefn volume helpers
- when dry_level = 0, vel is not returned as part of SVSlotSampleNote note_kwargs, which means vel uses a default value of 0, which returns a null arg
- trig.vel max(1) condition appears to be being bypassed during rendering
- remove ability to pass note arg to Nine09.note()
- separate SVSampleTrig class
- flatten demos structure
