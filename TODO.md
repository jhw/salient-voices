### thoughts

### thoughts

- avoid container.modules flattening modules?
  - but how? renaming?

### done

- rename SimpleBank as SimpleZipBank
- check why euclid doesn't seem to be calling container.render
- add back chatgpt script to initialise archive 
- change bank so it doesnt extend simple bank but is its own version
- initialise from zip but extend dict and keep stuff in memory.
- new init slices method to initialise slices as in memory items 
- create a merge branch for main + 01-berlin03-demo
- spawn blank patches after each for wash
- rename namespace as kick
- add filter function looking for BD in sample name
- add iterator block -> namespace, sample filter, density, temperature
- add new tracks for snare and hats
